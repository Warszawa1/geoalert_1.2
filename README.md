## Key Features
- User registration and profile creation
- Emergency link generation for emergency access
- Real-time geolocation
- Multi-language support based on location
- Integration with Dexcom for diabetes management
- Email and optional SMS alerts to emergency contacts
- Dynamic map for location confirmation
